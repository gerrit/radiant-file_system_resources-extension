= File System Resources

This enables the use of Radius-based layouts and snippets on the file system. Layouts go in RAILS_ROOT/radiant/layouts, and snippets go in RAILS_ROOT/radiant/snippets.

To move existing Snippets and Layouts from the DB into the file system, run 

  rake radiant:extensions:file_system_resources:dump
